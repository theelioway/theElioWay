## Nutshell

```shell
cd ~/Dev/theElioWay
git clone https://github.com/theElioWay.git
cd theElioWay
git submodule init
# all at once
git submodule update --recursive --remote
npm i
npm run prettier
```

## What we expect 

This repository is intended to demonstrate **the elioWay**'s design pattern implemented in the most accessable way. Think "bitesized". Even beginner developers should be able to understand every function and module; and how the libraries fit into the wider solution. 

Keep it simple and vanilla.

Use prettier. Write clean code. 

Write a good unit tests for your work. 

Beginners. Join in. We might not use your work, but if you contribute we will teach you how to write better code that is accepted. Learn from us.
